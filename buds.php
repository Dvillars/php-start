    <h1>Greetings From Afar</h1>
    <p>Dear <?php echo $friend_name; ?>,</p>
    <p>How are you? I hope that you are having a nice float. I'm vacationing in the mountains of Mt. Coronet while I learn great pokemon trainning pratices!</p>
    <p><?php echo $friend_name; ?>, you would not believe how cold it is here. I should have gone to the Alolan islands instead. But I wanted to see dawn, so I've been havin' fun.</p>
    <p>Looking forward to seeing you soon.</p>
    <p>Cheers,</p>
    <p>Derek</p>
